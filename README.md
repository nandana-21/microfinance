## What is Microfinance ? ##

Microfinance, also called Microcredit​, is a type of banking service that is provided to unemployed or low-income individuals or groups who otherwise would have no other access to financial services ie unbanked or underbanked. While institutions participating in the area of microfinance most often provide lending, many banks offer additional services, such as checking and savings accounts, and micro-insurance products; and some even provide financial and business education. Ultimately, the goal of microfinance is to give impoverished people an opportunity to become self-sufficient.

 **Working**

* A village is evaluated to see if microfinance is needed.
* If village is found suitable, an orientation is held to explain the functioning of the MFI.
* Those interested must make groups (of about 5) where all members are guarantors for each other i.e. they’re all responsible for paying back the collective loan and in case one fails, peer pressure is put on him to submit timely payment.
* A village center is chosen for weekly collection of payments which is overseen by the field officer.
* Loans are provided by the Branch officer.

## Problem associated with Microfinance Institutions - ##

* High rates of interest (25-40%) as compared to mainstream banks (8-12%) because of high risk involved also money transaction are quite slow and unsafe. Due to this, a situation of over-indebtedness arises and may result in higher suicide rates of borrowers.

* Property risk - Keeping all the assets in the form of cash is sometimes risky because of the because of the living environment 
Lack of risk management framework and multiple borrowings by most clients can lead to over-indebtedness and hence result in a microfinance crisis as it did in India 2008. To prevent this, MFIs usually increase their cost of monitoring.

* In such a setting, the people who put money into microfinance are completely invisible to the people who get microfinance, and vice versa. Hence, there is no provision for accountability. 

* Most of the MFIs are NGOs and get funded for their lending activities by commercial banks which are private and charge a high rate of interest for short periods of time. Over 80% of the MFIs funds come from these banks which leads to an overdependence to them.

* Presently the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) is the regulatory body for the microfinance industry in India. However it has traditionally catered to commercial and traditional banks rather than MFIs’. Not only has it led to constant structural and operational changes but also created ambiguity in norms of conduct. Therefore there is a need for a separate regulatory authority for this industry. 

* Lack of awareness of financial services provided by the Indian microfinance industry is a challenge for both customer and MFIs’. This factor not only causes hindrance for villagers to join hands with MFIs’ to meet their financial needs but also makes them financially excluded. MFIs’ are faced with the task of educating the people and establish trust before selling their product. Micro finance institutions struggle to make their business more financially viable due to this lack of awareness.
